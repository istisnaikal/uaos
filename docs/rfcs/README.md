# Requests for comments

An RFC proposes a change that is expensive to reverse:
- a contract or schema;
- the architecture or the ring boundaries;
- the security posture;
- licensing;
- governance.

The decision is then recorded as an ADR in [`docs/adr/`](../adr/). Small, reversible changes need
no RFC; a pull request is enough.

## Process

1. Copy [`template.md`](template.md) to `NNNN-short-title.md`, using the next free number, and open
   a pull request.
2. The RFC stays open for **at least 48 hours** (GOVERNANCE.md §Decisions).
3. It must carry a threat/privacy note and a test plan before it can be accepted.
4. The outcome is recorded as an ADR. The RFC is kept, marked accepted, rejected or withdrawn, and
   links to that ADR.

A change that crosses a red line in `CLAUDE.md` §1 cannot be accepted by vote. A security
maintainer can veto it by naming the missing proof and an alternative.
