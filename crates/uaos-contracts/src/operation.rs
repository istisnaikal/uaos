//! The Operation lifecycle (plan §2.4, ADR-0002).
//!
//! Every side effect UAOS mediates (model call, token count, tool call, exec, budget
//! transfer, config change) is an [`Operation`] and moves through exactly one state machine.
//! The machine is a pure function, so it can be exhaustively property-tested and replayed
//! from the journal.
//!
//! ```text
//! Proposed ─Authorize→ Authorized ─Reserve→ Reserved ─Execute→ Executing ─Commit→ Committed
//!    │ ├─Deny→ Denied      │ └─Deny/Fail→ Denied/Failed     │       └─Fail→ Failed
//!    │ └─RequireApproval→ ApprovalRequired (terminal; retry = new Operation)
//!    │                           Reserved/Executing ─CrashRecovered→ Indeterminate
//!    │                           Indeterminate ─ResolveCommitted/ResolveFailed→ Committed/Failed
//!    └ Committed/Failed ─Compensate→ Compensated   (only if compensable — red line 3)
//! ```
//!
//! Two honesty rules are enforced here rather than in review:
//! 1. An Operation whose effect is not compensable can never reach `Compensated`.
//! 2. `Indeterminate` is reachable only through crash recovery, and leaves it only through
//!    evidence (`ResolveCommitted` / `ResolveFailed`), never by assumption.
