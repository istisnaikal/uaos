//! Unified error taxonomy, `uaos.error/1` (plan §2.7).
//!
//! Every error UAOS itself originates has a registered code `UAOS-<DOMAIN>-<NNNN>`, a class,
//! a severity, a retry hint, a localizable message key, and a remediation pointer. The
//! registry below is the single source; reference documentation is generated from it.
//!
//! Two rules from the drop-in contract (ADR-0005):
//! * **Upstream provider errors are never rewritten.** Clients' recovery logic matches on the
//!   provider's wording; UAOS adds `x-uaos-*` headers and panel text only.
//! * **UAOS-originated errors use the client dialect's own error shape**, carrying this
//!   contract in a `uaos` extension object.
