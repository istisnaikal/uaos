//! The ledger writer: turns budget operations into recorded entries.
//!
//! Every entry is recorded through a [`LedgerSink`] (normally the journal) **before** the
//! in-memory state changes, so a reservation is durable before the Operation it pays for can
//! execute. If recording fails, the ledger refuses further work until it is rebuilt from the
//! journal: the entry may or may not have reached the journal, and guessing would let memory and
//! truth diverge.
//!
//! Reservations are typestate tokens. A [`Reservation<Held>`] may be released; once execution
//! starts, [`Reservation::begin`] turns it into a [`Reservation<InFlight>`], which can only be
//! settled — money that may already have been spent can never be released. Tokens are not
//! `Clone`, so a reservation cannot be settled twice in-process, and the state refuses a second
//! closing entry anyway. A closing call that is refused before anything is recorded hands the
//! token back ([`CloseError::Rejected`]).
//!
//! A token that is dropped leaves its reservation open and held: the money stays unavailable
//! until the next start. A ledger rebuilt from the journal ([`Ledger::replay`]) refuses new work
//! until [`Ledger::recover`] has closed what the previous run left open: unsettled reservations
//! are settled at the full reserved amount, marked `estimated`, never released.
//!
//! Limitation stated plainly: the journal does not yet record *when* execution began, so a
//! replayed ledger cannot tell a held reservation from an in-flight one. That is why recovery
//! never releases. The runtime journals the start of execution in P3 (WP3.3, ADR-0010).
