//! # UAOS identity: scoped credentials
//!
//! Agents never hold provider keys. They authenticate with credentials that UAOS issues
//! (ADR-0004, ADR-0011; cells C-07, C-08, C-09):
//!
//! * **recognisable:** `uaos_sk_` + base32 + a CRC-32 checksum, a format secret scanners can
//!   match. UAOS's own redaction class for it arrives with detector set v2 (WP2.4b);
//! * **stored as digests only:** HMAC-SHA-256 under an identity key held in the OS keychain.
//!   The secret is shown once and never journaled;
//! * **hierarchical:** master → sub → child, at most
//!   [`uaos_contracts::limits::MAX_CREDENTIAL_DEPTH`] long. A child's scope must be within its
//!   parent's, checked at issuance (records are immutable; narrowing means re-issuing). Live
//!   credentials are bounded overall and per parent;
//! * **revocable:** directly, or for a whole subtree by bumping an epoch. Every revocation is a
//!   critical journal record before it returns;
//! * **restore-safe:** a counter in the OS keychain detects a data directory restored from
//!   before a revocation. Verification and writes then fail closed until restore recovery
//!   revokes every live master. A counter that is deleted or implausible also fails closed.
//!
//! Like the ledger, the identity is a pure replay of its journal entries (`identity.entry`).
