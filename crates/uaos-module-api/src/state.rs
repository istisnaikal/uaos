//! Pocket-scoped module state and how it stays in step with the journal (contract §5).
//!
//! A module that remembers keeps its state per (module, pocket), never shared between pockets
//! (C-18). The state reflects the pocket's journaled events up to a [`PocketCursor`]. A
//! checkpoint is persisted by the host as a chunk under the pocket's key (ADR-0007), so shredding
//! a pocket shreds its module states with it; this crate defines the shapes, the host encrypts and
//! stores.
