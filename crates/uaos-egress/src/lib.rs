//! # UAOS egress: the one door
//!
//! Every outbound byte UAOS sends on a user's behalf leaves through [`Door::send`] (I-07). The
//! standard and tokio entry points that open sockets, send UDP, resolve names or build another
//! HTTP client are banned elsewhere in `clippy.toml`, with this crate as their only owner, and
//! `arch.toml` lets only the runtime depend on it. Those bans cover the listed entry points; a
//! dependency that opens sockets on its own is kept out by `arch.toml` and supply-chain review,
//! not by the bans.
//!
//! What the door guarantees (ADR-0013, threat T5):
//! * **Declared destinations only.** It connects to configured upstreams, named by DNS names;
//!   address literals in any spelling are refused ([`host`]).
//! * **It owns DNS.** It resolves, classifies every answer, and dials the classified address
//!   itself. Private, loopback, link-local, metadata and other special-purpose ranges are
//!   refused, including inside IPv4-mapped, NAT64 and 6to4 forms ([`addr`]). An upstream
//!   declared private may also reach loopback, private and unique-local addresses, never
//!   link-local; plain HTTP is dialled only at pinned local addresses and never resolved.
//! * **No fetches during TLS.** Certificates are verified against the system's roots by rustls
//!   itself, so a server's certificate cannot make UAOS fetch an issuer or revocation URL of its
//!   choosing ([`Trust::System`]).
//! * **No redirects.** A redirect is returned to the caller as a response, never followed.
//! * **Nothing added.** Hop-by-hop headers, `host` and `content-length` are removed, a request
//!   that carries a credential-bearing header is refused, and no UAOS header is added. The only
//!   insertion is the provider credential, placed last, after the runtime's final scan, and
//!   marked sensitive so it is never printed (I-05).
//! * **One send per Operation.** A request bound to another Operation, or a second request for
//!   the same Operation, is refused before any contact (ADR-0010's binding check).
//! * **No contact by default.** Building the door contacts nothing; [`Door::counters`] lets a
//!   test prove zero resolutions and connections (I-14).
//! * **Bounded.** Idle connections per upstream, the replay window, resolution, connect,
//!   handshake and response-header timeouts, addresses tried and request body size are limited
//!   (I-08). Concurrent requests and response bodies are bounded by the runtime
//!   ([`DoorLimits`]).
//!
//! What it does not do: retries (hyper-util's transparent retry is switched off), routing,
//! pricing and redaction belong to the runtime and its stages; the door carries out one
//! authorized, scanned request.
