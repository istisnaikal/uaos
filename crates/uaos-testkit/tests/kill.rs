//! The `journal-durability` gate (CLAUDE.md §4, ADR-0003, ADR-0018): kill a real writer process
//! at random points and prove that every acknowledged record survives, unchanged, on the real
//! filesystem, **and so does the payload it references**: in balanced mode chunks are only
//! handed to the OS, never flushed, before the record that references them is acknowledged.
//!
//! Kill points: after k acknowledgements, after a random delay, or before the writer has printed
//! `start`, while it opens the store and recovers the journal. So the writer is caught blocked
//! on its output, in the middle of journal I/O, and in the middle of recovery. Iterations:
//! `UAOS_CRASH_ITERATIONS` (default 40 per merge; nightly runs use 10,000). Seed:
//! `UAOS_CRASH_SEED` (printed on failure for replay).
//!
//! Payload sweeps, `UAOS_CRASH_SWEEP`:
//! * `every-kill` (the default, the merge lane): after every kill, every payload acknowledged in
//!   the directory is read back;
//! * `rotation` (the nightly lane): after every kill, the payloads acknowledged since the last
//!   writer that finished its open started are read back (normally the only ones after the
//!   `FLUSHED` marker, which a recovery rewrites), and every payload of a directory is read back
//!   before the directory is retired. A loss never heals in this
//!   harness (no content is stored twice, a lost chunk is quarantined, the parent only reads),
//!   so the sweep before retirement catches every loss a sweep after every kill would; only the
//!   iteration it is reported at differs, and the seed replays it.
